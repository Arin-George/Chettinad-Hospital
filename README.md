Hospital Management System

A full-stack web application built using Node.js and Express for the backend, MongoDB with Mongoose for database management, and CSS for clean, responsive styling. This platform allows patients to book appointments, view doctor profiles, and access medical services online, while administrators can manage doctors, patients, appointments, and service records. Secure authentication ensures safe access for both staff and patients, and the system is designed for smooth navigation and efficient data handling. With its user-friendly interface and robust backend, this project delivers a complete hospital management solution for both healthcare providers and patients.
